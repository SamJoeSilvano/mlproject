## Project Overview

The **Student Exam Performance Indicator** is a web application designed to assist teachers and educational institutions in analyzing student exam performance and gaining insights to improve educational outcomes. By leveraging machine learning, this tool predicts a student's performance and suggests personalized educational strategies for improvement.

The key objectives of this project are:
- To visualize trends in student performance using interactive charts.
- To predict exam results using machine learning models with an R² score of **0.879**.
- To help teachers tailor their teaching strategies based on predicted outcomes.

---

## Features
- **Data Visualization**: Provides insightful visualizations of student performance data (e.g., distribution of scores, correlation between variables, etc.).
- **Prediction Engine**: Predicts student exam scores based on multiple attributes like gender, parental level of education, and previous scores.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: User-friendly interface where teachers can explore and analyze the predictions.
- **Customizable Reports**: Generates reports for each student, highlighting areas of improvement and strengths.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Database**: SQLite (can be replaced with any relational database)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Deployment**: Docker (optional), Gunicorn (optional)

---

## Data Pipeline

1. **Data Ingestion**: Loading the student performance data from a CSV file.
  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizations of student performance using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - Key insights include score distribution, feature relationships, and performance trends.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing data, categorical encoding (one-hot encoding), and normalization.
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Multiple models were trained, including **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**.
   - **Hyperparameter tuning** using GridSearchCV was performed to optimize performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The selected model achieved an **R² score of 0.879**, making it ideal for predicting student exam scores.
   - Metrics used: **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **R² Score**, and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.

---

## Model Evaluation

After experimenting with various models, **Random Forest** emerged as the best-performing model for this problem. It was evaluated on the test set, and the following metrics were achieved:

- **R² Score**: 0.879
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: <calculated MSE>
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: <calculated RMSE>

The model was selected for its ability to generalize well on unseen data and its interpretability in a classroom setting.
